## 🔍 Key Insights
### 1.   Top Content-Producing Countries  
The United States leads by a significant margin in the number of Netflix titles available. India, the United Kingdom, and Canada follow, showing a strong presence of content from both Western and Asian regions. This insight is important for understanding regional production trends and Netflix’s global outreach.
### 2.   Content Type – Movies vs. TV Shows  
Out of the total titles, approximately   68% are Movies   and   32% are TV Shows  . This shows that Netflix is primarily movie-focused, which may influence user preferences, licensing strategies, and content recommendations.
### 3.   Genre Analysis (Listed In Column)  
The most common genres on Netflix are   Documentaries  ,   Dramas  , and   Stand-Up Comedy  . These genres cater to diverse audience interests — from informational and emotional storytelling to light-hearted entertainment.
### 4.   Release Year Trend  
There is a clear spike in content release from   2017 to 2020  . This shows Netflix's aggressive growth strategy, likely driven by competition and increasing global subscriptions. After 2020, a slight drop is visible, possibly due to production slowdowns during the pandemic.
### 5.   Ratings Distribution  
  TV-MA   and   TV-14   are the most frequently assigned content ratings, indicating a large portion of content targeted toward mature teens and adult audiences. Ratings such as   PG   and   G   are less frequent, showing a smaller catalog for children and families.
### 6.   Content Availability by Country  
Countries like   Brazil, France, Japan, and South Korea   also show noticeable content presence. This highlights Netflix’s localization efforts and content diversification to meet regional demands.
### 7.   Date Added Insights  
Most content was added between   2018 and 2020  . This reveals Netflix’s bulk acquisitions or new additions during that phase — possibly to maintain subscriber growth and engagement.
